# NOTE TO DEVELOPERS
------

Firstly, I want to say thank you very much for helping me to improve this
project. But..., we all admit that a unified genra and style of the source code
among the whole project is very important to the readability, maintainability
and usability of the project. So we strongly suggest you can adhere to the 
following rules when coding.

## Main developing language

Fortran 90 is our main developing language.
Of course Fortran 90 cannot do everything, and it can not solve all problems 
efficiently. So, other languages can be chosen when there is ready-made source
code, such as the specialized math functions. These verified source code in 
other languages can be used in this project without any changes. But if you do 
this, make sure the licenses of them are all compatible with that in this
project and make acknowledgement in your source code file and let us know this
when you make a commitment.

The priority sequence of the source code languages of this project are:
1. Fortran 90
2. Fortran 77
3. C/C++
4. Python

The following rules for the genre and style of this project's source code are
defined for Fortran 90 languages, but you can make an analogy for other
languages, such as Fortran 77 and C/C++. 

Once more, we strongly suggest you can adhere to the following rules when
coding.
